     </div>
     <p>Small Samurai is a rouge like where you get perks after every 2 enemy waves. I'm the most proud about the simple but efficent enemy AI.</p>
     <P>This was the last game i ever made in Unity. It was made in about 2 weeks time as a small compition between me and my freind</P>
     <p>It's was also my first time making 2D art myself. </p>

     </div>
     <p>Child of war is a small (not so great) game that i coded with my freind during the span of 2 months. We also got help with all the character art from another freind</p>
     <P>Child of war is a 2D side scrolling platformer that's supposed to depict the horrors of war from the perspective of a child.</P>
     <p>This game was made for a school talent contest but we overscoped it quite a bit so we barely play tested it and had to cut out a lot of content. But it was a great learning experince</p>

     </div>
     <p>Potato of truth was one of the first game i ever made. Its a 3D frist persson stroy game made for a game jam during the span of a weekend with a freind</p>
     <P>It's a really really bad game but it was a really really good learning experince but unforunatle we overscoped a lot of games after this beacuse of how much we tought we made in such a sort time. this would end up shooting us in the foot for quite a while. Not finsihing any games for quite a while.</P>
